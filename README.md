### My Key Projects & Contributions

As part of my work at the Klaus-Tschira-Institute (Dieterich Lab), I have had the privilege to lead and contribute significantly to several key AI and Bioinformatics projects. Below are some highlights:

---

#### 1. LLM Relations: Knowledge Graph Generation from Scientific Text
*   **Project Link:** [dieterich-lab/LLM_Relations](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/LLM_Relations)
*   **My Role:** **Lead Developer & Architect.** I designed and implemented the core framework for using Large Language Models (Mistral, Llama) to extract molecular interaction data and construct a biological relation graph. This involved prompt engineering, developing the data processing pipeline, and setting up the system architecture.

#### 2. RNA/Protein XLNet Framework: Half-Life Regression & Classification
*   **Project Link:** [dieterich-lab/rna_protein_xlnet](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/rna_protein_xlnet)
*   **My Role:** **Lead Developer & Maintainer.** I built this framework from the ground up, using XLNet and CNN/LSTM backends in PyTorch. A key feature is the integration of interpretability methods like SHAP and Integrated Gradients to analyze the model's predictions.

#### 3. Saluki CNN: Sequence-based Modeling of RNA Half-life
*   **Project Link:** [dieterich-lab/rna_saluki_cnn](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/rna_saluki_cnn)
*   **My Role:** **Core Contributor.** I contributed to the development and optimization of the CNN architecture for regressing RNA half-lives, focusing on improving the model's performance and the robustness of the data pipeline.

#### 4. BioLM Utils: Shared Utilities for Biological Language Models
*   **Project Link:** [dieterich-lab/biolm_utils](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/biolm_utils)
*   **My Role:** **Creator & Maintainer.** I created this shared library to consolidate common functions and tools used across our various bioinformatics projects, improving code reusability and accelerating development.
