### Hi there, I'm Philipp üëã

I'm an AI Scientist specializing in Generative AI and Natural Language Processing. My passion is building intelligent systems that can decipher complex, human-generated data ‚Äì from ancient languages to modern clinical records.

Below is a selection of key projects I've led or significantly contributed to during my time at the Klaus-Tschira-Institute (Dieterich Lab).

### üöÄ Key Projects & Contributions

#### 1. LLM Relations: Knowledge Graph Generation from Scientific Text
*   **Project:** `dieterich-lab/LLM_Relations`
*   **My Role:** **Lead Developer & Architect.** I designed and implemented the core framework for using Large Language Models (Mistral, Llama) to extract molecular interaction data and construct a biological relation graph.
*   *Note: My specific contribution can be viewed in the project's subdirectories.*

#### 2. RNA/Protein XLNet Framework: Half-Life Regression & Classification
*   **Project:** [`dieterich-lab/rna_protein_xlnet`](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/rna_protein_xlnet)
*   **My Role:** **Lead Developer & Maintainer.** I built this framework from the ground up, using XLNet and CNN/LSTM backends in PyTorch, including the integration of XAI methods (SHAP).

#### 3. Saluki CNN: Sequence-based Modeling of RNA Half-life
*   **Project:** [`dieterich-lab/rna_saluki_cnn`](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/rna_saluki_cnn)
*   **My Role:** **Core Contributor.** I contributed to the development and optimization of the CNN architecture for regressing RNA half-lives.

#### 4. BioLM Utils: Shared Utilities for Biological Language Models
*   **Project:** [`dieterich-lab/biolm_utils`](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/biolm_utils)
*   **My Role:** **Creator & Maintainer.** I created this shared library to consolidate common functions and tools, improving code reusability across projects.

### üåç Community & Open Source Contributions

#### Ancient Egyptian Translation Dataset
*   **Hugging Face Link:** [`phiwi/bbaw_egyptian`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/phiwi/bbaw_egyptian)
*   **Context:** This project connects my unique background in both Egyptology and Computational Linguistics. I curated, processed, and uploaded this dataset to the Hugging Face Hub to make it accessible for the community, enabling new research in low-resource machine translation. This work is directly related to my IWSLT 2019 publication on translating ancient texts with Transformer models.

*   **Languages:** Python, Bash, Cypher, Java
*   **AI/ML:** PyTorch, Huggingface, Langchain, LlamaIndex, Scikit-Learn, Spacy
*   **Infrastructure & Data:** Docker, Git, HPC/Slurm, Neo4j, FAISS, MongoDB
